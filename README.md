# Cyber DNA Profiler (CDNAP)

## Overview

The Cyber DNA Profiler (CDNAP) is an open-source project aimed at revolutionizing cybersecurity through the concept of "Cyber DNA". This system creates and analyzes profiles of software, networks, and cyber attacks using machine learning and graph theory to identify patterns, predict vulnerabilities, and attribute attacks with high accuracy.

## Project Goals

1. Develop a robust "Cyber DNA" representation for software and networks
2. Create tools for generating and analyzing Cyber DNA profiles
3. Implement machine learning models for pattern recognition and prediction
4. Build a community-driven database of attack patterns and vulnerability signatures
5. Provide intuitive visualization and analysis tools for cybersecurity professionals

## Current Status

CDNAP is in its early stages of development. We are currently focusing on building the core DNA modeling system and basic analysis tools. Contributions are welcome!

## Features (Planned)

- Software Genome Mapping
- Network Ecosystem Profiling
- Attack Pattern Sequencing
- Predictive Vulnerability Analysis
- Attacker Attribution through Genetic Markers
- Evolutionary Analysis of Cyber Threats
- Cross-Platform Genetic Analysis
- Privacy-Preserving DNA Sharing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
